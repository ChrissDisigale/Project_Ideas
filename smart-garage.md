# Smart garage mobile app
 *its an idea of a mobile app that will work as a smart garage*
 the main purpose is to provide help to the drivers whenever they run into a problem with their vehicles.
 The app will use Artificial inteligence to provide simple solutions when the driver mention a problem.
 The app will locate the drivers live location and will show nearby garage, filling stations or mechanic in case the driver need one.
 Also the app will have alert system which drivers will use to call for help incase of accident or any other emergency
 later on the app will have delievery system which will use drones to deliver things like oil, gas or water to the drivers who are in remote places and they have got a problem.
